        <h1>Fertilizers</h1>
        <p>Fertilizers are substances that are added to soil to provide nutrients that are essential for the growth of plants. They are typically used to supplement the nutrients that are naturally present in soil, as some soils may not have enough of certain nutrients to support optimal plant growth. Fertilizers can be synthetic, meaning they are made from chemicals, or they can be natural, meaning they are derived from plants or animals. The three primary nutrients that are essential for plant growth are nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. These nutrients are usually present in fertilizers in the form of nitrates, phosphates, and potash, respectively. </p>
